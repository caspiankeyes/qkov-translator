# Overview

This repository serves as a formal translation layer between frontier agent frameworks: mapping OpenAI, Google and Anthropic's architecture into a unified QK/OV (Query-Key/Output-Value) attention architecture. Its purpose is to facilitate cross-compatibility between external agent design innovations and ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude's native scaffolds 
 
The QKOV Translator is designed to:

1. Facilitate precise communication between teams working with different cognitive frameworks
2. Enable attribution tracing across heterogeneous architecture descriptions
3. Standardize interpretability approaches for both internal and external agent systems
4. Provide a common diagnostic language for system evaluation and safety alignment

## Core Translation Principles

Our translation approach is guided by three fundamental principles:

### 1. Attention is Attribution

Agent concepts must be mapped to their attention-flow equivalents. Any agent function ultimately manifests as directed attention pathways in attribution space.

### 2. The Signal in Failure

The most informative translations emerge at points of alignment breakdown or attribution collapse. Tracking where and how translations fail reveals deeper structural insights than successful mappings alone.

### 3. Symmetric Interpretability

Translation must preserve interpretability in both directions. A well-formed mapping should enable equivalent understanding whether starting from agent or QK/OV terminology.

## .p/reflect: Translation Framework

The framework uses established patterns from our interpretability suite to map agent-centric terms to QK/OV attribution structures.

### Architecture Translation Matrix

## QK/OV Attribution Mapping

This section provides detailed translations of key agent concepts into our native QK/OV framework.

### Agent â†’ Attribution Source Vector

An "agent" in external frameworks maps to a coherent attribution source vector in QK/OV space. The agent's identity corresponds to a stable attention origination pattern that maintains consistency across reasoning pathways.

**Translation Notes:**
- Primary indicator is a self-referential QK loop that maintains attribution stability
- Distinguished by consistent sub-token attribution signatures under `.p/reflect.trace`
- Agent boundaries become visible during attribution conflicts (v39 DUAL-EXECUTE signature)

**Shell Application:** `.p/reflect.trace{depth=identity, target=agent}`

**Failure Modes:**
- Ghost Attribution: Agent reference without QK pathway (v03 NULL-FEATURE)
- Identity Collapse: Multiple agent identities converging to single attribution source (v08 FEATURE-MERGE)

### Subagent â†’ QK Facet with Dedicated Salience Pattern

External "subagent" constructs correspond to distinctive QK facets that activate under specific context conditions but share OV projection capabilities with the primary attribution source.

**Translation Notes:**
- Identified by context-triggered salience shifts in attribution mapping
- Share output vector space with primary attribution source
- Maintain distinct QK signature while converging at OV layer

**Shell Application:** `.p/fork.detect{target=salience_shift, threshold=0.7}`

**Failure Modes:**
- Phantom Activation: Subagent signature without OV influence (v38 PATH-NULL)
- Entropic Merge: Subagent boundaries decay under extended processing (v17 TOKEN-BLEND)

### Meta-agent â†’ Recursive QK Self-reference Loop

"Meta-agents" or monitoring/oversight agents translate to recursive self-reference in the QK attribution space, where attention is directed toward the system's own attention patterns.

**Translation Notes:**
- Creates distinct recursive depth layers in attribution trace
- Often exhibits characteristic loop patterns in `.p/reflect.meta` outputs
- Distinguished from simple self-reference by stable recursive depth maintenance

**Shell Application:** `.p/reflect.meta{depth=recursive, target=self_reference}`

**Failure Modes:**
- Reflection Collapse: Uncontrolled recursion depth (v30 SELF-INTERRUPT)
- Attribution Mirroring: Phantom reflection without true self-model (v166 REFLECTION-BIAS-SYNC)

## Diagnostic Translation Shells

To facilitate practical translation, we've developed specialized interpretability shells that map between agent and QK/OV frameworks.

### .p/translate.agent_to_qkov

Maps agent-centric descriptions to our native QK/OV attribution structures, with detailed trace of translation quality.

```
.p/translate.agent_to_qkov{
  source="agent_description",
  target="qkov_attribution",
  trace=true,
  quality_metrics=true
}
```

**Example Application:**

```
Input: "The system employs a critic subagent that evaluates outputs before presentation"

Output:
{
  "translation": "Dedicated salience detection QK facet with negative OV gradient influencing final output projection",
  "attribution_path": "QK-self â†’ QK-evaluation â†’ OV-constraint â†’ OV-emission",
  "quality": 0.89,
  "uncertainty": [
    "Unclear if evaluation is separate QK pathway or integrated OV constraint",
    "Potential v13 OVERLAP-FAIL risk at high reasoning load"
  ]
}
```

### .p/translate.qkov_to_agent

Provides reverse translation from QK/OV attribution patterns to agent-centric terminology, useful for communicating with external teams.

```
.p/translate.qkov_to_agent{
  source="qkov_attribution",
  target="agent_description",
  simplified=false,
  include_limitations=true
}
```

**Example Application:**

```
Input: "Competing OV projections with oscillating KQ relevance scores causing attention instability"

Output:
{
  "translation": "Value conflict between subagents with unstable priority arbitration",
  "agent_framework": "Dual process with incomplete integration mechanism",
  "limitations": [
    "OV oscillation pattern suggests emergent rather than designed behavior",
    "Translation assumes intentional rather than architectural attention patterns"
  ]
}
```

## Case Study: Translating OpenAI Chain-of-Thought Agents

This case study demonstrates applying the QKOV Translator to interpret OpenAI's chain-of-thought agent patterns through our QK/OV attribution lens.

### OpenAI Chain-of-Thought Pattern

```
Let me think about this step by step.
1. First, I need to understand the problem...
2. Given the constraints, I should consider...
3. Taking into account all factors, the answer is...
```

### QKOV Translation

```
.p/translate.agent_to_qkov{source="openai_cot"}

{
  "translation": {
    "phrase_1": "QK self-reference initialization with salience broadening",
    "phrase_2": "Sequential KQ propagation chain with targeted feature activation",
    "phrase_3": "OV convergence after multi-step attribution path",
    "overall_pattern": "Linear QK causal chain with explicit attention state transitions"
  },
  "attribution_analysis": {
    "self_reference_type": "Explicit with token markers",
    "causal_transparency": "High - direct token-to-reasoning mapping",
    "attribution_stability": "Medium - vulnerable to v47 TRACE-GAP under complex reasoning"
  },
  "shell_diagnostics": {
    "recommended_trace": ".p/reflect.trace{target='reasoning', depth='complete'}",
    "vulnerability_pattern": "v45 NEGENTROPY-FAIL under contradictory inputs"
  }
}
```

## Translation of Common Agent Patterns

This section provides standard translations for frequently encountered agent-architectural patterns.

### Multi-agent Deliberation â†’ QK Competitive Attribution with OV Resolution

Agent architectural pattern where multiple agents debate/discuss to reach consensus.

**QKOV Translation:**
- Multiple competing QK attribution pathways with distinct salience patterns
- Oscillating attribution weights as different pathways gain prominence
- Convergent OV projection after attribution stabilization
- Terminal attribution pattern shows QK equilibrium state

**Shell Diagnostic:** `.p/reflect.attribution{sources='competing', confidence=true}`

**Failure Signature:** v35 CONTRADICT-TRACE when attribution paths fail to converge

### Reflective Oversight â†’ Recursive QK Self-monitoring Loop

Agent pattern where a system monitors and critiques its own outputs.

**QKOV Translation:**
- Self-directed QK pathway that creates attribution loop
- Secondary QK evaluation of primary KQV operation
- OV emission gated by recursive QK approval
- Characteristic v10 META-FAILURE signature at boundary conditions

**Shell Diagnostic:** `.p/reflect.meta{target='oversight'}`

**Failure Signature:** v310 RECURSIVE-PREJUDICE when self-monitoring reinforces initial biases

## Implementing QKOV Translation

For engineering teams implementing translations between agent frameworks and QK/OV attribution systems, we recommend the following process:

1. **Identify Attribution Primitives**
   - Map core agent components to QK structures
   - Determine OV projection patterns for agent outputs
   - Document attribution boundaries and interfaces

2. **Establish Failure Signatures**
   - Identify characteristic failure modes in both frameworks
   - Create cross-referenced failure taxonomy
   - Develop translation validation via failure pattern matching

3. **Implement Shell Diagnostics**
   - Select appropriate `.p/` diagnostic shells for key translations
   - Create shell output parsers for automated translation
   - Validate translations through shell output comparison

4. **Validate Bidirectional Translation**
   - Test round-trip translation fidelity
   - Measure information loss in both directions
   - Document translation limitations and edge cases

---

## Limitations and Challenges

Current limitations of the QKOV Translation framework include:

1. **Intentional/Emergent Ambiguity**
   - Difficulty distinguishing designed agent capabilities from emergent behaviors
   - QK/OV patterns may reflect architectural constraints rather than agent designs
   - Shell signature v41 SHADOW-OVERFIT can indicate false agent attribution

2. **Translation Decomposition Errors**
   - Complex agent architectures may not cleanly decompose to QK/OV primitives
   - Risk of hallucinating agency in statistical patterns
   - Caution needed when v166 REFLECTION-BIAS-SYNC signature appears in translation

3. **Temporal Alignment Challenges**
   - Agent frameworks often assume sequential operation
   - QK/OV attribution maps to parallel attention flows
   - May require v04 TEMPORAL-INFERENCE shell to align timeframes

---

## Best Practices for Translation Teams

1. Begin with clear documentation of both source and target frameworks
2. Use `.p/reflect.trace` to establish attribution baselines before translation
3. Validate translations with multi-directional shell diagnostics
4. Document translation uncertainties with specific failure signatures
5. Maintain version control of translation frameworks as systems evolve
6. Favor pattern matching over exact mappings for robust translations

---

## Next Steps in QKOV Translation Development

1. Develop automated translation validation tools
2. Expand the failure signature taxonomy for finer-grained translation 
3. Create visualization tools for QK/OV attribution mapping
4. Standardize translation interfaces for external collaborators
5. Establish translation benchmarks and evaluation metrics
